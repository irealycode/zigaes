# EAS Encryption Algorithm in Zig

This project aims to implement the EAS (Encrypted Algorithm Suite) encryption algorithm from scratch, along with all the underlying algorithms it uses. The implementation is written in **Zig**, a programming language known for its performance, safety, and simplicity.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Recreate the EAS encryption algorithm from the ground up.
- Implement all associated cryptographic algorithms in Zig.
- Ensure clarity, performance, and correctness in the codebase.

## Features

- **EAS Encryption Algorithm**: Full implementation of the core encryption and decryption algorithm.
- **Sub-Algorithms**: Includes all algorithms and utilities needed for the EAS encryption (e.g., key generation, padding, hashing, etc.).
- **Written in Zig**: Utilizing the Zig programming language to ensure efficient and reliable cryptographic operations.
